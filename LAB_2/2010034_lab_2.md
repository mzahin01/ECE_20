## Experiment No: 2

**Experiment Name:** Best Coding Practice

## Objectives:

- Learn about maintainable coding examples
- Understand how to make code readable
- Learn conventional methods for naming variables or functions

<br>

## 1. camelCase:

- In camelCase, the first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter.
- Commonly used for variable names and function names in JavaScript and many other programming languages.

### Use Cases:

- **JavaScript:** Variables, function names
- **Java:** Variables, method names
- **C++:** Variables, function names
- **C#:** Variables, method names
- **Swift:** Variables, function names
- **TypeScript:** Variables, function names
- **PHP:** Variables, method names
- **Go:** Variables, function names
- **Ruby:** Variables, method names

### Examples:

#### Variable name in JavaScript

```javascript
let userName = "Minhajhul";
let totalScore = 100;
```

### Function names in JavaScript

```javascript
function calculateSum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```

## 2. PascalCase:

- In PascalCase, the first letter of each word is capitalized.
- Commonly used for class names and constructor functions.

### Use Cases:

- **Java:** Class names
- **C#:** Class names, namespaces, properties, method names
- **JavaScript (React.js):** Component names
- **TypeScript:** Class names, interfaces
- **Swift:** Type names (structs, classes, enums)
- **Python:** Class names (following the PEP 8 style guide)
- **Ruby:** Class and module names

### Examples:

```javascript
class UserProfile {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```

```javascript
function UserCard() {
    return <div>User Card</div>;
}
```

## snake_case:

- In snake_case, all letters are lowercase, and words are separated by underscores.
- Commonly used in Python for variable names and function names.

### Use Cases:

- **Python:** Variables, function names, file names (following PEP 8 style guide)
- **Ruby:** Variables, method names, file names
- **C:** Variables, function names
- **PHP:** Function names, variables (especially in older codebases)
- **SQL:** Column names, table names
- **Rust:** Variable and function names
- **Elixir:** Function names, variables

### Examples:

```python
user_name = 'Minhajul'
total_score = 100
```

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b):
        return a + b
```

## kebab-case:

- In kebab-case, all letters are lowercase, and words are separated by hyphens.
- Commonly used for file and folder names, especially in web development for CSS classes and HTML IDs.

### Use Cases:

- **HTML/CSS:** Class names, IDs, file names
- **URLs:** Used in web addresses for better readability
- **JavaScript/Front-End Frameworks:** Vue.js and Angular often use kebab-case for component or directive names

### Examples:

```css
.text-center {
    text-align: center;
}

.main-header {
    font-size: 24px;
}
```

## Discussion:

Naming conventions like camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, and kebab-case are crucial for making code more readable, maintainable, and consistent. Different programming languages adopt specific naming standards that fit their syntax and style, creating a universal way for developers to structure their code. For instance, JavaScript often uses camelCase for variables and functions, while PascalCase is widely adopted for class names in object-oriented languages like Java and C#. Meanwhile, snake_case is popular in Python, promoting clarity in both variables and function names, and kebab-case finds its place in CSS classes and URLs. Adhering to these standards across languages and contexts ensures that code is easily understandable, even for developers new to a project.

## Conclusion:

Choosing the right naming convention is not just a matter of preference; it significantly affects the readability and maintainability of code. Following language-specific conventions helps teams collaborate more effectively and minimizes errors. By consistently using camelCase, PascalCase, snake_case, and kebab-case where appropriate, developers can create a clear, organized codebase that aligns with industry standards, making it easier to onboard new team members and ensure long-term code sustainability.

## Experiment No: 3

**Experiment Name:** Study of Different Git Commands

## Objectives:

- Learn and explore different Git commands
- Explore different Git commands for managing repositories
- Understand the purpose and usage of Git commands

## Table of Contents

1. **Introduction to Git**
2. **Fundamental Git Operations**
     - Initializing a Repository
     - Cloning a Repository
     - Checking Status
     - Adding Changes
     - Committing Changes
3. **Branching and Merging**
4. **Advanced Commands**
5. **Collaboration with Git**

## 1. Introduction to Git

Git is a distributed version control system that lets multiple users collaborate on a project efficiently. It maintains a history of changes, supports branching, and ensures seamless teamwork.

---

## 2. Fundamental Git Operations

### Initializing a New Repository

- **Purpose:** To start tracking your project's files with Git.
- **Command:**
    ```bash
    git init
    ```

### Cloning an Existing Repository

- **Purpose:** To copy an existing project from a remote server.
- **Command:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Minhajul/repo.git
    ```

### Checking the Status of the Repository

- **Purpose:** To display the state of your working directory.
- **Command:**

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

### Adding Files to Staging Area

- **Purpose:** To prepare files for a commit.
- **Command:**

    ```bash
    git add filename
    git add .
    ```

### Committing Changes

- **Purpose:** To save staged changes in the local repository.
- **Command:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add descriptive message here"
    ```

## 3. Branching and Merging

### Creating and Switching:

- Create a branch

```bash
git branch new-feature
```

- Switch to a branch

```bash
git checkout new-feature
```

### Merging:

```bash
git merge feature-branch
```

## 4. Advanced Commands:

- Stashing changes:

```bash
git stash
git stash apply
```

- Viewing Commit History:
```bash
git log
```

- Reset to previous commit:
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
- Reverting Changes:
```bash
git revert commit-id
```

## 4. Collaboration with Git:

### Remote Repo management:
- Add a remote repo:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/Minha/repo.git
```
- View Remote Repositories:
```bash
git remote -v
```
- Fetch Changes without Merging:
```bash
git fetch origin
```
- Pull and Merge Changes:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Conclusion:
This lab covered essential Git commands, highlighting their practical applications for managing code repositories. Mastering these commands is crucial for efficient project collaboration and version control.
